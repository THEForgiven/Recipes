# Recipes
This is a Flask web app that allows a user to create recipes and downloads them as a PDF file into a Recipes folder.

Directions:  In the terminal create a folder in your main directory called "Recipes" within "Recipes" create another folder called "templates".  Copy the index.html file into the folder "templates" and copy the app.py file into the main "Recipes" folder.  Go to terminal and the working directory path where "Recipes" is found.  Type "python3 app.py"  and you should see a localhost link created.  Click on the link and it will open a webpage where you can give your recipe a simple title that will also become the filename, fill in the appropriate ingredient amounts and ingredient names, fill in the directions on how to prepare and when complete, click on CreatePDF to generate a pdf file saved in the browser download.  I also have it download into my directory "/home/myname/Documents/Recipes"  just change that in the app.py file to your favorite directory.
